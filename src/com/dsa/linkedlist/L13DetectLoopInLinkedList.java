/**
 * 	Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.
	
	Example 1:
	Input:
	N = 3
	value[] = {1,3,4}
	x(position at which tail is connected) = 2
	Output: True
	Explanation: In above test case N = 3.
	The linked list with nodes N = 3 is
	given. Then value of x=2 is given which
	means last node is connected with xth
	node of linked list. Therefore, there
	exists a loop.

	Example 2:
	Input:
	N = 4
	value[] = {1,8,3,4}
	x = 0
	Output: False
	Explanation: For N = 4 ,x = 0 means
	then lastNode->next = NULL, then
	the Linked list does not contains
	any loop.
