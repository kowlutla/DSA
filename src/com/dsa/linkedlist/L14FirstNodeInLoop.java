/**
 * 	Given a singly linked list of N nodes. Find the first node of the loop if the linked list has a loop. If a loop is present return the node data of the first node of the loop else return -1.
	
	Example 1:
	Input: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3
	Output: 3
	Explanation:
	We can see that there exists a loop 
	in the given linked list and the first
	node of the loop is 3.
	 
	
	Example 2:
	Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3-> 4
	Output: -1
	Explanation: No loop exists in the above
	linked list.So the output is -1.
